# Personal Web Page

Welcome to my **personal web page**, created as part of the **Fullstack Bootcamp** I'm taking at The Bridge. This project brings together the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired on my own over the past few months, as well as during my first week of the bootcamp, showcasing my abilities in **web development**, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   git clone https://github.com/deydre/pagina-web-personal.git

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.


## 🌱 Challenges Faced
- I found some complexity in creating the hamburger menu in CSS with Flexbox, but it was simple to animate in JS.
- It was difficult to reorganize the project at the HTML and JS level when I moved the HTML files to the pages folder.
- Validating the form with JS has been complicated when it comes to storing the inputs, labels, and clearly understanding what each thing is.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- UX / Make the menu and footer less intrusive when scrolling.
- UX / Night Mode toggle for the entire website.
- Portfolio / Project filtering by tag.
